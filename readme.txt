The Berlin Database of Emotional Speech provides an audio dataset with 535 audiofiles (http://emodb.bilderbar.info/index-1280.html) with ten different spoken texts. These texts are spoken by different speakers and in various emotions. With this code, it was investigated whether Python has issues transcribing when people express different emotions. Interestingly, Python transcribed almost everything correctly.
